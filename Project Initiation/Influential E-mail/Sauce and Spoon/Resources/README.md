## Week 1 Updates

The following documents were used to draft an influential email:

- [Week 1 - Email_Stakeholder Intro.pdf](link-to-stakeholder-pdf)
- [Week 1 - Meeting_Identify Mutual Benefits.pdf](link-to-mutual-benefits-pdf)

### Step 1: Review the Supporting Materials

Review the email exchange and meeting transcript from the PDFs above. Make note of the following details:

- Each person’s involvement with the project
- Their stated position on the expansion
- Any mutual benefits that could result from keeping the tablet rollout confined to the bar area (remember, a mutual benefit is when all parties involved gain some kind of value or advantage)

You are also encouraged to make note of any other relevant project information. You may add this information to your notes or the project charter.

### Step 2: Identify One Person to Join Your Coalition

Based on your notes, identify one potential ally to support you in pushing back against the expansion. You can choose from among the following stakeholders:

- Gilly
- Alex
- Larissa
- Zane
- Seydou
- Carter

When choosing a potential supporter, consider how much power and influence they have (it may be helpful to refer to your stakeholder analysis and power grid). Your coalition must have enough power and influence to help you convince two senior stakeholders—Deanna, the Director of Operations, and Omar, the owner of Sauce & Spoon—that expanding the rollout is not a good idea.

### Step 3: Write an Email to Your Potential Supporter

After identifying one potential supporter, write an email asking them to join your coalition. Make sure that the email has a subject line, greeting and introduction, body, conclusion, and closing.

Your email should also include the following:

- A short summary of Omar’s request to expand the rollout
- At least two reasons why expanding the rollout may be unwise
- A request to help you convince Omar and Deanna to stick with the original plan and limit the rollout to the bar area

### Step 4: Apply Conger’s Four Steps of Effective Influencing

As you compose your email, remember to apply Conger’s steps to influence others effectively:

1. Establish credibility
2. Frame for common ground
3. Provide evidence
4. Connect emotionally

When planning your influencing approach for your email, consider your audience, their involvement in the project, and their thoughts on the expansion. Think about how an expanded test launch might affect them, as well as any mutual benefits that could affect them.
