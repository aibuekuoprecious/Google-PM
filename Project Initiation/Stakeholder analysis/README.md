### Stakeholder Analysis Template

[Link to Stakeholder Analysis Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LIK80uR00tmr7rcrDKuRQkjDlaY-AhAPIoVPIPhoxKk/edit#slide=id.g9455395c98_0_31)


### Guiding Questions:

- How much power does each stakeholder have? A stakeholder’s power is related to how much influence they have and how much their actions affect the project outcome.
- How much interest does each stakeholder have? Interest refers to how much the stakeholder’s needs will be affected by the project’s operations and outcomes.

### Notes:

You are encouraged to also make note of any other relevant project information. You may add this information to your notes or the project charter.

### Step 4: Complete the Stakeholder Analysis

In the stakeholder analysis template, add content to the first slide based on what you’ve learned from the supporting materials, including:

- **Stakeholder:** What is their name?
- **Role:** What is their role?
- **Power (H/M/L):** Is their power over the project high, medium, or low?
- **Interest (H/M/L):** Is their interest in the project high, medium, or low?

For example, a stakeholder who has a lot of power over the project could have a number of other responsibilities as well. In that case, they may not have as much direct interest, since their attention is split among many different projects. They would be considered high power and low interest.

On the other hand, a stakeholder who will be directly impacted by the decisions of the project (for example, their budget or staffing allocations could change), but who doesn’t have any authority to influence the decisions would be considered low power and high interest. If you’re not sure about a stakeholder’s level, or if their power or interest falls somewhere in the middle, you can assign them a medium rating.

### Step 5: Complete the Power-Interest Grid

Take your assessment from the stakeholder analysis and add content to the power-interest grid, according to each level of power and interest you assigned them (high, medium, or low). Assign each stakeholder to a box. If you rated a stakeholder’s power or interest as medium, place them between the grid boxes.

Someone's position on the grid shows you the actions you have to take with them:

- **Higher power, higher interest:** These people are your highest priority. You must manage them closely and make every effort to fully engage with them.
- **Higher power, lower interest:** These people require a high level of effort to keep satisfied, as far as the success of the project is concerned, but do not want to be overburdened with project communications.
- **Lower power, higher interest:** Show consideration to these people by keeping them adequately informed. Talk to them to ensure that no major issues are arising. These people can often be very helpful with the details of your project.
- **Lower power, lower interest:** Monitor these people but do not overload them with excessive communication. These people require minimal effort.

Once the grid is complete, you will have a better sense of how to manage and communicate with each stakeholder: keep satisfied, manage closely, monitor, or show consideration.

### What to Include in Your Response

Be sure to include each of the following elements in your completed stakeholder analysis:

- Stakeholder names
- Stakeholder roles
- An assessment of each stakeholder’s power
- An assessment of each stakeholder’s interest
- A power-interest grid containing each stakeholder, mapped out according to their power and interest assessment
