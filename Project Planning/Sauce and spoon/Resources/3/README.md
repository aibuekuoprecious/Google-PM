# Project Plan - Time Estimates from Conversations and Additional Tasks

## Step 3: Determine time estimates from the conversations

- Review the conversation transcripts.
- Determine likely time estimates for the tasks being discussed.
- Add your time estimates under the Estimated Duration column on the Task Brainstorm tab of your project plan.
- If youâ€™ve identified a task from one of these conversations that was not already included in your project plan, add the new task and the time estimate to the Task Brainstorm tab.

## Add time estimates for other tasks in the project plan

- Review past project documentation and supporting materials.
- Add time estimates for 5-10 additional tasks to the project plan.

**What to Include in Your Response**

Be sure to include the following elements in your project plan:

- Time estimates for the new tasks referenced in the conversation transcripts (there are at least six tasks discussed in the supporting materials)
- Time estimates for 5-10 previously listed tasks
