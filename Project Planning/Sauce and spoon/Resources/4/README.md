# Project Plan - Confidence Rating

## Step 1: Review the supporting materials

Use the resources from folder 1, 2, and 3.

- Review the notes from the project team meeting.
- Take notes on the feedback Peta asks for on certain tasks.
- Keep in mind that you will be responsible for updating confidence ratings in the project plan.
- Make note of details related to best-case and worst-case scenarios.
- Note how confident the team is with the task estimates discussed at the meeting.

If you identify any new tasks from this meeting that were not already included in your project plan, you can add them to the Task column under the Task Brainstorm tab of your project plan.

## Step 2: Add three-point time estimates

Next, select at least four tasks and add three-point estimates for each task. Use the supporting materials provided in this and previous activities to determine:

- Optimistic time estimate
- Most Likely time estimate
- Pessimistic time estimate

Add these estimates to the corresponding columns under the Task Brainstorm tab in the project plan.

## Step 3: Add confidence ratings

Next, add confidence ratings to at least four of your tasks in the Confidence Ratings (H/M/L) column under the Task Brainstorm tab.

## Step 4: Add notes

Finally, add notes to at least four tasks. Notes can include any information on a task critical to time estimates or its completion. You can pull them from the project team meeting notes or any previous supporting materials.
