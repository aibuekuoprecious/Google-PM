**Guide: Make a list of 10 tasks**
Review the project charter, historical project plan, and email exchange and identify 10 tasks that might be required for the tablet rollout project. Identify at least one task from each supporting document. Remember that project tasks refer to activities that need to be accomplished within a set period of time, which eventually lead to the completion of a milestone. 

Then, add the tasks to the Task Brainstorm tab of your project plan in the Task column.

As you add your tasks, ask yourself the following Guiding Tips and Questions:

- Are there multiple tasks implied by a single sentence?
- Always ask yourself what decisions might need to be made before an action is taken and what testing might need to be done to verify the success of that action. These decisions and tests might also be considered tasks for the project plan.
